--> If you want to code in Visual studio then install "phython" and " runners" extensions.

--> Python Basic syntax:-

    -->Python Identifiers :
           - A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).
           - Python does not allow punctuation characters such as &commat;, $, and % within identifiers.

            -Python Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.

            -Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private identifier.

            -Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.

            - If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.

    --> Python Reserved Words:
          - there are some reserverd keywords which cant be used as constant or variable or any other identifier names.
          - All the Python keywords contain lowercase letters only
          - and,as,assert,break,class,continue,def,del,elif,else,except,False,finally,for,from

    --> Python Lines and Indentation:-

    --> Python Multi-Line Statements:-
          - Statements in Python typically end with a new line. 
          - Python does, however, allow the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue. 

    --> Quotations in Python:-
          -Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.
