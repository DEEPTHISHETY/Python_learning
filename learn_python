--> Install Python locally
--> If you want to code in Visual studio then install "phython" and " runners" extensions.

--> Python Basic syntax:-

    -->Python Identifiers :
            - A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).
            - Python does not allow punctuation characters such as &commat;, $, and % within identifiers.
            - Python Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.
            - Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private identifier.

            -Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.

            - If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.

    --> Python Reserved Words:
          - there are some reserverd keywords which cant be used as constant or variable or any other identifier names.
          - All the Python keywords contain lowercase letters only
          - and,as,assert,break,class,continue,def,del,elif,else,except,False,finally,for,from

    --> Python Lines and Indentation:-

    --> Python Multi-Line Statements:-
          - Statements in Python typically end with a new line. 
          - Python does, however, allow the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue. 

    --> Quotations in Python:-
          -Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.

    --> Comments in Python:-
        - A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment.
        - All characters after the # and up to the end of the physical line are part of the comment and the Python interpreter ignores them.
            - Following triple-quoted string is also ignored by Python interpreter and can be used as a multiline comments: [ '''   COMMENTS  ''']

    --> Multiple Statements on a Single Line:-
            - The semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on the single line given that neither statement starts a new code block.


--> Python Variables:-
            - Variables are used to store values.
            - Variables reserve the memory locations to store the values
            - Based on the variable data type, memory will be allocated to variable.
            - Python's built-in id() function returns the address where the object is stored.
            - For eg : 
                    name="deepthi"
                    print(id(name))

            - Create python variable : you create variable and assign variable using [=] sign.
                    name="deepthi"
                    age = 30

            - Printing Python Variables: you can print variable using print()
                    print(name)

            - Deleting Python Variables:- you can delete variable using "del" keyword.
                    name="deepthi"
                    age = 30
                    print(name)
                    print(age)
                    del age
                    print(age)

            - Getting Type of a Variable: you can use " type() " to get type of variable.
                    name="deepthi"
                    age = 30
                    print(name)
                    print(age)
                    print(type(age))

                    Output : deepthi
                             30
                             <class 'int'>

            - Case-Sensitivity of Python Variables: Python variables are case sensitive which means Age and age are two different variables
            - Python Variables - Multiple Assignment: 
                    a=b=c=10
            - Python Local Variables: Python Local Variables are defined inside a function. We can not access variable outside the function.
                    def sum(x,y):
                       sum = x + y
                       return sum
                    print(sum(5, 10))

            - Python Global Variables: Any variable created outside a function can be accessed within any function and so they have global scope.
                    x = 5
                    y = 10
                    def sum():
                        sum = x + y
                        return sum
                    print(sum())

            -Constants in Python: 
                    - you can define constant by using all-caps names with underscores. 
                    - For example, the name PI_VALUE indicates that you don't want the variable redefined or changed in any way.
